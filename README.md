# Exercise 2

When concrete is clicked the sequence:
1. rotates the crane to face the concrete
2. moves the trolley into position so that the hook can attach to the concrete
3. lowers the hook by scaling the cable untill the concrete is attached to the hook
4. waits 1 second then lifts the concrete to the cable minimum length
5. detaches the concrete and moves it to a random position which is reachable by the sequence

Know issues:
The trolley's movement doesn't work properly and isn't constrained to moving on the arm between the movement limits.
